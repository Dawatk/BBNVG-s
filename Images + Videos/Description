# Notes:

Most of the photo's and videos in this folder are from the first couple of units I made and some comparisons between visible light and the IR view via the monocular.

I want to point out the two "box" jpg's. These are pictures of my first functional build using the adafruit display's box as a housing for the whole system. This worked great as something to just house the circuitry and keep everything in one place while i brought it around testing different lighting conditions but was obviously not a permanent solution.
