# BBNVG-s
Bootleg Bootleg Night Vision Goggles adopted from BPNVG V2 by Stubbs

# Description:
I've wanted to build a set of active night vision goggles for a while and once I found the BPNVG by stubbs (later picked up by justcallmekoko on github for bino adaptation), I started building.

This repo is my space to track any problems I encounter, changes I make, or parts that I've found can work as replacements if things aren't available.

# Notes:
I've made a couple of units so far with the Night Eagle 3 V2 + Adafruit 2" PAL display, and while bulky, they work great especially with some ambient light (half to full moon works well) or IR light.

Recently I've found a few items I plan to implement as improvements. First, the CaddxFPV Infra V2 Camera, this camera is very similar to the night eagle 3, its an ultra-low light camera, outputting analog for the FPV user, but the CaddxFPV product introduces an "AI Box" that supposedly enhances image clarity by more than 30% in low-light conditions. The price point is slightly higher but from what i've seen on their website and a user on youtube demoing the product, it's legit so I'm going to try it.

Secondly, the V760A-5 is a portable wearable head mounted HD display. From what I understand, these eye pieces use something similar to this ECX .5" display (https://vonscherfarms.com/ECX-5-Display-p662008681), and claim to provide a resolution of 1024x760 which is a drastic improvement to the 320x240 resolution of the current adafruit display I'm using. Another plus to this eyepiece is it's all housed in a compact cylendrical footprint with a rubber eyepiece, making the housing integrationg much easier and less bulky. The only downside is they do all come from china so places like ebay and alibaba are really the only sources you can purchase from. Link: https://www.ebay.com/itm/364810977446

These two changes, while increasing the build cost, should improve the image quality and degree of usability tenfold.
